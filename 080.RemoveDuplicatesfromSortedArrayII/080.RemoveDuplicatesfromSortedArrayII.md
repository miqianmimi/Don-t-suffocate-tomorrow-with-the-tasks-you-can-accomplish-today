# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

### Qusestion:
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.


### Example:
```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

### Analysis:

### Solution:
```Python
class Solution(object):
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0
        i = 0 
        for j in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[j] or (i>0 and nums[i] != nums[i-1]) or i==0:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = nums[j]
        return i+1
```
